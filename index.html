              <li>
                  <strong>Natural Language Processing with Hugging Face Transformers:</strong> This project involved utilizing Hugging Face Transformers for various NLP tasks, including text summarization, sentiment analysis, and translation. By exploring pre-trained models, I was able to enhance the accessibility of real-time translation services, making them more efficient and user-friendly for diverse audiences.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>AI Data Assistant:</strong> In this project, I developed a sophisticated AI Data Assistant using LangChain, Python, JavaScript, Flask, CSS, HTML, and the OpenAI API. The tool analyzes PDF documents and provides insightful answers, leveraging advanced technology to extract and interpret information quickly and accurately. This project highlighted my ability to integrate multiple technologies to solve complex data analysis problems.
